<p>Spring is traditionally one of the strongest seasons for car buying in Europe — and 2026 is no exception. If you've been watching Tesla prices, following the software updates, or simply wondering whether now is the right moment to pull the trigger, this guide is for you.</p>
<h2>Tesla Model Y: Still the King of European EVs</h2>
<p>The Tesla Model Y remains Europe's best-selling electric vehicle, and spring 2026 brings fresh reasons to consider one. What's different in the refreshed Model Y: redesigned front and rear fascia, upgraded interior with quieter cabin and ambient lighting, longer range (LR AWD now exceeds 600 km WLTP), and full access to FSD (Supervised) via subscription in most EU markets.</p>
<p>Current European pricing (indicative, VAT included): Model Y RWD from €43,990 · Model Y LR AWD from €52,990 · Model Y Performance from €59,990. Switzerland tends to be CHF 1,000–3,000 higher.</p>
<h2>Tesla Model 3 Highland: The Sleeper Hit</h2>
<p>The refreshed Model 3 Highland offers a premium interior that rivals German luxury sedans, RWD or LR AWD configurations, updated software, and significantly improved NVH. Current pricing: Model 3 RWD from €39,990 · LR AWD from €50,990 · Performance from €58,990.</p>
<h2>What's New in Software: FSD in Europe</h2>
<p>Tesla began rolling out FSD (Supervised) v13 to European vehicles in late 2025. By spring 2026 most newer Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Western Europe have access. It includes automatic lane changes, Navigate on Autopilot, Auto-park, Smart Summon, and city streets FSD in approved areas. It remains Level 2 ADAS — driver must stay attentive. Available as ~€99–129/month subscription.</p>
<h2>Tesla Charging in Spring 2026</h2>
<p>Tesla's Supercharger network now covers over 3,500 stations across Europe. All V3 and V4 Superchargers are open to non-Tesla vehicles. V4 chargers (250 kW+) are rolling out at major hubs. For Tesla owners, charging remains seamless — pay per kWh (typically €0.30–0.55/kWh).</p>
<h2>Is Spring a Good Time to Buy?</h2>
<p>Yes. End-of-quarter pushes (March 31 = Q1 close) historically bring enhanced incentives and faster deliveries. New inventory vehicles appear in spring and can deliver faster. Referral codes unlock free Supercharging credits. Order before March 31 to capture Q1 benefits.</p>
<h2>How to Use a Tesla Referral Code in Europe</h2>
<p>Enter a referral code at checkout when ordering. Use referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> or the direct link: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460">https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a>. Both buyer and referrer receive benefits — free Supercharging credits or accessories. It costs nothing and takes 10 seconds.</p>
<h2>Should You Wait for the Tesla Model 2?</h2>
<p>As of spring 2026, no confirmed European launch date exists for a sub-€30,000 Tesla. Rumours point to 2026–2027 production. Our take: if you need a car now, don't wait. The Model Y RWD at ~€44,000 is extremely competitive when you factor in lower running costs.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Tesla's European lineup has never been stronger. If you're buying this spring: choose Model Y (space) or Model 3 (refinement), consider LR AWD for range, order before March 31 for Q1 incentives, and use a referral code.</p>
<p>👉 <strong>Order with referral code <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460">carlo719460</a> to get your free Supercharging credits.</strong></p>
