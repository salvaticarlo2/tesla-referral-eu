      <h1>Tesla Model Y 7-Seater Now Available in Europe — But Is It Worth €2,500?</h1>
      <div class="article-meta">Published February 28, 2026</div>

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Tesla has launched the <strong>seven-seat option for the Model Y Juniper</strong> across Europe, adding a €2,500 third-row option to the Long Range All-Wheel Drive configuration. Deliveries are expected to start in <strong>April 2026</strong>.</p>

      <p>The option is now available to order in Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and other European markets. It bumps the price of the Premium Long Range AWD from <strong>€52,990 to €55,490</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What You Get for €2,500</h2>
      <p>The seven-seat configuration adds two forward-facing seats in the cargo area. Tesla says it retains <strong>381 litres of cargo space</strong> behind the third row — enough for two carry-on suitcases. Fold those rear seats flat and you're back to 894 litres, roughly the same as the five-seat version.</p>

      <p>The catch? <strong>The third row is small.</strong> This is the same Model Y platform with the same 2,890 mm wheelbase. The seats are realistically only suitable for small children. Adults will find it cramped for anything beyond very short trips.</p>

      <p>The seven-seat option is exclusively available on the <strong>Long Range AWD variant</strong>. You can't add it to the Standard Range.</p>

      <h2>The Elephant in the Room: Model YL</h2>
      <p>Here's where it gets complicated. In China, Tesla already sells the <strong>Model YL</strong> — a stretched version of the Model Y with a wheelbase extended by 150 mm (about 6 inches). It offers a <strong>2-2-2 captain's chair configuration</strong> with genuinely usable second and third rows.</p>

      <p>The Model YL launched in China last August at roughly $47,000 and has been selling well. It's a fundamentally different proposition: proper third-row legroom, individual seats with armrests, and a vehicle that can genuinely replace a family MPV.</p>

      <p><strong>Tesla has not announced the Model YL for Europe.</strong> But given the demand and the fact that the standard 7-seat take rate has historically been low (Tesla even removed the option in China before launching the YL), many expect it to arrive eventually.</p>

      <h2>Should You Order the 7-Seater or Wait?</h2>
      <p>It depends on your situation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>You need occasional third-row seats for kids under 10</strong> — the €2,500 option makes sense. It's there when you need it and folds flat when you don't.</li>
        <li><strong>You need real third-row space for teens or adults</strong> — wait for the Model YL, or consider a Model X (while it's still available).</li>
        <li><strong>You rarely need more than 5 seats</strong> — save the €2,500. The standard Model Y's boot space is more useful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Order with a Referral Code</h2>
      <p>If you're ordering a Model Y — whether 5 or 7 seats — use a referral code to get <strong>free benefits</strong>. Tesla's referral programme currently offers Supercharging credits and other perks for both the buyer and the referrer.</p>
