  <p>Whether you're buying a Tesla in Germany, France, Norway, or any other European country, there's one universal tip that can save you up to <strong>€500</strong> before you even configure your car: use a Tesla referral code. This guide covers everything you need to know about the Tesla referral program across Europe in 2026 — including country-specific details, language notes, and the most common pitfalls to avoid.</p>

  <p>The referral code below is active, verified, and works across all European Tesla markets.</p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Tesla Referral Code Europe 2026:</strong> Use referral link <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a> before configuring your Tesla in any European country. Code: <strong>carlo719460</strong>. Benefit: up to €500 in free Supercharging credits or Tesla account credits.
  </div>

  <h2 id="overview">The Tesla Referral Program in Europe</h2>

  <p>Tesla's referral program (also known as the Tesla Owners Referral Program) has been running in various forms since 2015. In 2026, it remains one of the most straightforward ways for new Tesla buyers in Europe to receive a meaningful benefit at no extra cost.</p>

  <p>Here's the core idea: every Tesla owner receives a personal referral link. When a new buyer orders a Tesla using that link, both the buyer and the existing owner receive rewards. For buyers, the reward is up to €500 in value — either free Supercharging credits or Tesla account credits, depending on the model.</p>

  <p>The referral program is <strong>pan-European</strong> — the same referral code works in all countries where Tesla sells directly. You don't need a country-specific code. One link covers Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Norway, and everywhere else in Europe.</p>

  <p>The one condition: you must click the referral link <em>before</em> starting your order. The referral is stored as a browser session cookie — if you navigate directly to tesla.com or start configuring without the referral link active, the code won't be attached to your order.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to">How to Use the Tesla Referral Code — Step-by-Step</h2>

  <div class="step-list">
    <div class="step-item">
      <div class="step-num">1</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Click the Referral Link First</h3>
        <p>Open <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</strong></a> in your browser. This is the critical step — do this before anything else. The link embeds the referral code into your session automatically. You'll land on Tesla's model overview page.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step-item">
      <div class="step-num">2</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Confirm Your Country and Currency</h3>
        <p>Tesla's website automatically detects your location and switches to the appropriate country site (e.g., tesla.com/de_de for Germany, tesla.com/fr_fr for France). Confirm that prices are shown in your local currency and the language is correct. The referral code works regardless of which country version you're on.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step-item">
      <div class="step-num">3</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Configure Your Tesla</h3>
        <p>Select your model, then choose color, wheels, interior, and any software options. During configuration, you'll see the referral benefit indicated in your order summary. If you don't see it, go back and re-open the referral link — don't proceed without confirming it's attached.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step-item">
      <div class="step-num">4</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Place Your Order</h3>
        <p>Complete the checkout process as normal. Your referral benefit will be credited to your Tesla account after vehicle delivery. Check the Tesla app under "Referral Benefits" to confirm receipt.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>💡 Universal tip for all countries:</strong> The referral code is stored as a browser cookie. If you close your browser, switch devices, or clear cookies between sessions, you'll need to re-click the referral link. Bookmark it, or just re-open it each time you start a new configuration session.

  </div>

  <p>The referral benefit is the same across all European countries. Whether you're ordering in Germany (€), France (€), Norway (NOK), or Switzerland (CHF), the benefit is calculated at equivalent value in your local currency.</p>

  <h2 id="germany">🇩🇪 Germany — Tesla Empfehlungscode 2026</h2>

  <p>Germany is Tesla's largest European market by volume. The Berlin Gigafactory (Gigafactory 4 in Grünheide, Brandenburg) supplies much of Europe with Model 3 and Model Y units, meaning German buyers often benefit from shorter delivery timelines.</p>

  <p>In German, the referral code is called the <strong>Tesla Empfehlungscode</strong> or <strong>Empfehlungslink</strong>. German Tesla communities on Reddit (r/TeslaDE) and forums frequently share referral codes, but many reach their limits. The code <strong>carlo719460</strong> is verified active for German orders in 2026.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> Tesla Empfehlungscode 2026 / Tesla Empfehlungslink Deutschland</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> 1,500 km free Supercharging (Model 3/Y) or €500 Tesla credits (Model S/X)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> The national Umweltbonus ended in late 2023, but some Bundesländer still offer regional EV support</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery hub:</strong> Gigafactory Berlin — fastest delivery for Model 3 and Y in Europe</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="france">🇫🇷 France — Code Parrainage Tesla 2026</h2>

  <p>France is one of Europe's most EV-friendly markets, thanks to the <em>bonus écologique</em> government incentive and strong infrastructure investment under the IRVE program. Tesla's Model Y has been the best-selling EV in France for multiple consecutive years.</p>

  <p>In French, the referral is called the <strong>code parrainage Tesla</strong> or <strong>lien de parrainage</strong>. The referral benefit is fully compatible with the bonus écologique — you receive both, independently of each other.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> code parrainage tesla 2026 / lien parrainage tesla france</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> 1,500 km Supercharge gratuit (Model 3/Y) ou €500 crédits Tesla (Model S/X)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> Bonus écologique still active in 2026 for qualifying buyers</li>
    <li><strong>Leasing compatibility:</strong> Works with LOA and LLD leasing arrangements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="netherlands">🇳🇱 Netherlands — Tesla Referralcode 2026</h2>

  <p>The Netherlands was one of the earliest Tesla markets in Europe and has one of the highest Tesla ownership rates per capita on the continent. The Dutch EV market is mature, with excellent charging infrastructure and strong consumer familiarity with Tesla vehicles.</p>

  <p>In Dutch, the referral is called a <strong>Tesla referralcode</strong> or <strong>aanbevelingscode</strong>. The referral program has been running continuously in the Netherlands since Tesla's early European days.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> tesla referralcode nederland / tesla kortingscode 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> 1,500 km gratis Superchargen (Model 3/Y) of €500 Tesla-tegoed (Model S/X)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> Dutch BPM exemption for EVs remains in place in 2026; bijtelling rates favour EVs for business drivers</li>
    <li><strong>Notable:</strong> The Netherlands has the highest Supercharger-to-road-km density in Europe</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="switzerland">🇨🇭 Switzerland — Tesla Empfehlungscode / Code Parrainage 2026</h2>

  <p>Switzerland is a premium EV market with high Tesla adoption, particularly in urban cantons like Zurich, Geneva, and Basel. Swiss Tesla orders are priced in <strong>CHF (Swiss Francs)</strong>, and the referral benefit is credited in CHF equivalent.</p>

  <p>Switzerland uses three official languages, so the referral is known as <em>Empfehlungscode</em> (German), <em>code parrainage</em> (French), or <em>codice referral</em> (Italian) depending on the canton.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> tesla referral code schweiz / tesla empfehlungscode 2026 schweiz</li>
    <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Prices in CHF; referral benefit in CHF equivalent (~550–580 CHF)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> Several Swiss cantons offer cantonal EV incentives on top of the federal level; varies by canton</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> Swiss orders ship from Gigafactory Berlin; typical 4–10 week window</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="italy">🇮🇹 Italy — Codice Referral Tesla 2026</h2>

  <p>Italy is one of Europe's fastest-growing Tesla markets, with the Model Y dominating EV sales in major cities. Italian Tesla buyers are enthusiastic adopters, and the referral program has strong participation across Italian Tesla communities.</p>

  <p>In Italian, the referral is known as the <strong>codice referral Tesla</strong> or <strong>codice di riferimento</strong>. Searching for <em>codice referral tesla 2026</em> or <em>codice sconto tesla italia</em> will bring up various owner codes — make sure you're using an active one like carlo719460.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> codice referral tesla 2026 / codice di riferimento tesla italia</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> 1,500 km di Supercharging gratuito (Model 3/Y) o €500 crediti Tesla (Model S/X)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> Italy's EV incentive scheme (<em>incentivi auto</em>) for 2026 varies; check MIMIT for current rates by income bracket</li>
    <li><strong>Charging network:</strong> Tesla has significantly expanded Italian Supercharger coverage, with stations on major autostrade and in Milan, Rome, Florence, Naples</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="spain">🇪🇸 Spain — Código de Referido Tesla 2026</h2>

  <p>Spain's EV market is growing rapidly, supported by the MOVES III government incentive program and increasing urban charging infrastructure. Tesla is expanding its Spanish operations, with new Supercharger stations opening across the Iberian Peninsula throughout 2025–2026.</p>

  <p>In Spanish, the referral is called the <strong>código de referido Tesla</strong> or <strong>enlace de referido</strong>. The program works identically to other European markets.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> código referido tesla 2026 / referido tesla españa 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> 1,500 km de Supercarga gratuita (Model 3/Y) o €500 créditos Tesla (Model S/X)</li>
    <li><strong>Local incentives:</strong> MOVES III incentives still available in some Spanish regions; check IDAE (Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía) for current availability</li>
    <li><strong>Growing network:</strong> Supercharger coverage across Spain has doubled since 2023</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="norway">🇳🇴 Norway — Tesla Referansekode 2026</h2>

  <p>Norway is the world's most EV-saturated market — more than 90% of new cars sold in Norway in recent years have been electric. Tesla has been a fixture on Norwegian roads since the early 2010s. Nearly one in five cars on Norwegian roads is now a Tesla.</p>

  <p>In Norwegian, the referral is called a <strong>Tesla referansekode</strong> or <strong>anbefaling</strong>. Norwegian Tesla orders are priced in <strong>NOK (Norwegian Krone)</strong>, and the referral benefit is equivalent to approximately 5,500–6,000 NOK in Supercharging credits for Model 3 and Y buyers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local keyword:</strong> tesla referansekode 2026 / tesla rabattkode norge</li>
    <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Prices in NOK; referral benefit equivalent to approx. 5,500–6,000 NOK</li>

    <li><strong>Charging:</strong> Norway has the world's best EV charging infrastructure per capita; Tesla Superchargers are at most major petrol stations and highway stops</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-countries">Other European Countries</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>🇦🇹 Austria (Österreich)</strong> — Tesla Empfehlungscode; strong EV support with regional subsidies in Vienna and other Bundesländer</li>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, in all countries. The Tesla referral benefit is paid by Tesla directly and is completely separate from government EV subsidies. You can receive both simultaneously. This applies to the French bonus écologique, Norwegian VAT exemption, UK plug-in grant (if applicable), Italian incentivi auto, and any other national or regional EV incentive.</p>

      <summary class="faq-question">How long are the Supercharging credits valid across Europe?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Free Supercharging credits from the referral program are valid for <strong>12 months</strong> from the date they're credited to your Tesla account, which typically occurs at vehicle delivery. The Tesla Supercharger network now covers all major European highways, making it easy to use your credits wherever you drive.</p>

      <summary class="faq-question">Does the referral code work for Tesla leasing across Europe?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes. The referral benefit applies regardless of how you pay — outright purchase, Tesla financing, or leasing (LOA/LLD in France, PCP/PCH in the UK, operational leasing across other markets). The benefit is tied to your vehicle order, not your payment structure.</p>
