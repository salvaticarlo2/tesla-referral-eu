  <p>Tesla's referral program is one of the most valuable perks available to new buyers anywhere in Europe — and yet many buyers miss it simply because they don't know about it before they configure their vehicle. This <strong>complete guide</strong> covers everything you need to know about the <strong>Tesla referral code Europe 2026</strong>: what it is, how it works, what you receive for each model, and market-specific details for every major European country.</p>

  <p>The bottom line: by using referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> before you order, you can receive up to <strong>€500</strong> in free Supercharging credits or Tesla account credits — at zero extra cost. One click, applied before you configure, done.</p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Tesla Referral Code Europe 2026:</strong> <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a> — Save up to €500 on any new Tesla in any European country. Code: <strong>carlo719460</strong>. Must be used before starting your order.
  </div>

  <h2 id="referral-code">The European Referral Code</h2>

  <p>The referral code is <strong>carlo719460</strong>. This is linked to my personal Tesla owner account. When you use the referral link below to start your Tesla order, Tesla's system registers you as a referred buyer and applies the appropriate benefit to your order automatically. No manual code entry is needed.</p>

  <p>One referral code works across all European countries. Whether you're ordering from Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Norway, or any other European Tesla market — the same link works everywhere:</p>

  <div class="cta-box">
    <p><strong>Tesla Referral Code Europe — Save up to €500</strong></p>
    <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="btn-primary">Order with referral code carlo719460 →</a>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.85;">Use this link before configuring your Tesla. Works in all European countries.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How the Tesla Referral Program Works</h2>

  <p>Tesla launched its referral program in 2015, and it has remained one of the most consistently generous owner-referral programs in the automotive industry. The structure is straightforward:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every Tesla owner has a unique referral link tied to their account code</li>
    <li>When a new buyer uses that link to purchase a new Tesla, both parties receive benefits</li>
    <li>The new buyer receives free Supercharging credits or Tesla account credits</li>
    <li>Benefits are credited to the buyer's Tesla account at vehicle delivery</li>
    <li>The cost to the buyer is zero — the price of the vehicle does not change</li>
    <li>The referral benefit can be combined with any other current Tesla promotions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <strong>Tesla referral program in Europe</strong> operates identically to the US version, with the benefit values expressed in euros and the Supercharging credits usable at any Tesla Supercharger across the continent. There are no region-specific restrictions on where you can spend your referral Supercharging credits — you can charge in Germany today and use those same credits at a Supercharger in Spain next month.</p>

  <p>Tesla periodically updates the specific benefit amounts. The values listed in this guide reflect the program as of early 2026. Always verify the current benefit in your order summary when you configure your vehicle.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use It (Step-by-Step)</h2>

  <p>The process takes less than a minute. The critical rule: <strong>use the referral link before you start configuring your Tesla</strong>. It cannot be added after the order is placed.</p>

    <div class="step-item">
      <div class="step-num">1</div>

        <p>Click <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</strong></a>. This opens the Tesla Design Studio with the referral code pre-applied. Do not navigate to tesla.com directly first — the referral won't carry over from the homepage.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 id="benefits">Benefits by Model</h2>

  <p>The referral benefit varies depending on which Tesla model you order. Here's what European buyers receive with code <strong>carlo719460</strong> in 2026:</p>

  <div class="card-grid" style="margin: 24px 0;">
    <div class="card">
      <span class="benefit-tag">Free Supercharging</span>
      <h3>Model 3</h3>
      <p>Up to <strong>1,500 km of free Supercharging</strong> credits added to your account at delivery. Valid for 12 months. Works at all Supercharger locations across Europe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <span class="benefit-tag">Free Supercharging</span>
      <h3>Model Y</h3>
      <p>Up to <strong>1,500 km of free Supercharging</strong> — perfect for exploring Europe's growing Supercharger network from day one. Europe's best-selling EV.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <span class="benefit-tag">Tesla Credits</span>
      <h3>Model S</h3>
      <p>Up to <strong>€500 in Tesla credits</strong>. Redeemable for Supercharging sessions, Tesla shop accessories, or available software upgrades.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <span class="benefit-tag">Tesla Credits</span>
      <h3>Model X</h3>
      <p>Up to <strong>€500 in Tesla credits</strong>. The premium SUV with Falcon Wing doors — start ownership with €500 of Tesla credits already in your account.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 id="germany">Germany (Deutschland) 🇩🇪</h2>

  <p>Germany is Tesla's largest single European market by volume. The Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in Grünheide, which has been operational since 2022, produces Model Y for the entire European market — giving German buyers some of the best delivery times on the continent.</p>

  <p>The Tesla referral code is called the <em>Tesla Empfehlungscode</em> or <em>Tesla Empfehlungslink</em> in German. The code <strong>carlo719460</strong> works for all German orders. With the end of the Umweltbonus (government EV purchase subsidy) in Germany, the referral benefit has become one of the most accessible ways to reduce your initial Tesla ownership costs.</p>

  <p>Key for German buyers: Model Y is manufactured locally, so delivery times are typically shortest for this model. Model 3 Highland is increasingly popular as a Dienstwagen (company car) due to favourable benefit-in-kind taxation for EVs in Germany.</p>

  <h2 id="france">France 🇫🇷</h2>

  <p>France has one of Europe's most active EV markets, supported by the <em>bonus écologique</em> government incentive scheme and a dense Supercharger network. The Tesla Model Y was among the top five best-selling vehicles in France for 2024 and 2025 — not just among EVs, but across all powertrains.</p>

  <p>In French, the referral program is called the <em>programme de parrainage Tesla</em> and the code is a <em>code parrainage Tesla</em>. Using <strong>carlo719460</strong> before ordering your Tesla in France gives you the same benefits as anywhere else in Europe. Importantly, the referral benefit is fully compatible with the bonus écologique — you can receive both.</p>

  <p>French Tesla buyers particularly benefit from the free Supercharging credits on routes like Paris–Lyon–Marseille, Paris–Bordeaux, and cross-border trips to Spain or Italy.</p>

  <p>➜ Full guide: <a href="/blog/tesla-referral-france/">Tesla Referral Code France 2026</a></p>

  <h2 id="netherlands">Netherlands (Nederland) 🇳🇱</h2>

  <p>The Netherlands has the highest EV adoption rate in Europe by percentage of new car registrations, and Tesla has been a dominant force in the Dutch market for years. Dutch Tesla buyers benefit from the <em>BPM</em> (purchase tax) exemption for EVs, which makes Teslas significantly more competitively priced than in many other European markets.</p>

  <p>In Dutch, the referral is a <em>Tesla verwijzingscode</em> or <em>referralcode</em>. The code <strong>carlo719460</strong> works for all Dutch orders. With Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht all well-served by Superchargers — and the Netherlands acting as a major corridor for cross-European EV travel — the free Supercharging credits are particularly valuable for Dutch buyers.</p>

  <p>For Dutch-language information about the referral program, visit our <a href="/nl/">Nederlandse pagina</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="switzerland">Switzerland (Schweiz / Suisse / Svizzera) 🇨🇭</h2>

  <p>Switzerland is a strong Tesla market despite not being an EU member. Swiss buyers benefit from no import duties on EVs from the EU, and the Swiss franc's strength means Tesla pricing in Switzerland is competitive relative to neighbouring countries.</p>

  <p>The referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> works for Swiss orders, with benefits displayed in Swiss francs (CHF) in the order summary. For Model 3 and Model Y, buyers receive up to 1,500 km of free Supercharging; for Model S and Model X, up to CHF equivalent of €500 in Tesla credits.</p>

  <p>Switzerland is notable for its excellent Supercharger coverage, particularly in the Alpine regions — Geneva, Zurich, Basel, Bern, Lausanne, and Lugano all have multiple Supercharger locations. Alpine road trips using referral Supercharging credits make the benefit immediately useful.</p>

  <h2 id="italy">Italy (Italia) 🇮🇹</h2>

  <p>Italy's EV market has been growing steadily, with Tesla establishing a strong presence in northern Italy (Milan, Turin) and increasingly across the peninsula. The Italian government has offered EV purchase incentives under the <em>Incentivi auto</em> scheme, which is compatible with the Tesla referral benefit.</p>

  <p>In Italian, the referral code is a <em>codice referral Tesla</em> or <em>codice amico Tesla</em>. Using referral link <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a> before ordering in Italy provides the same up to €500 in benefits.</p>

  <p>Italy's Supercharger network has expanded significantly in recent years, with good coverage along the A1 (Autostrada del Sole from Milan to Naples), the A14 (Adriatic coast), and major tourist destinations including Rome, Florence, Venice, and the Italian Riviera.</p>

  <p>For Italian-language information, visit our <a href="/it/">pagina italiana</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="spain">Spain (España) 🇪🇸</h2>

  <p>Spain is an emerging Tesla market with significant growth potential. The Spanish government offers EV purchase incentives under the MOVES III program, and Tesla has been expanding both its sales network and Supercharger footprint across the country.</p>

  <p>In Spanish, the referral is a <em>código de referido Tesla</em>. The code <strong>carlo719460</strong> works for all Spanish orders. Spain's geography makes the Supercharger network critical for long-distance travel — and the free Supercharging credits from the referral are valuable for covering Spain's substantial distances, particularly on routes like Madrid–Barcelona (600 km) or Madrid–Seville (530 km).</p>

  <p>Tesla has Supercharger locations across Spain's major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao, and Zaragoza, as well as along the main autopista routes connecting them.</p>

  <h2 id="norway">Norway (Norge) 🇳🇴</h2>

  <p>Norway is the global leader in EV adoption — more than 90% of new car sales are now fully electric. Tesla has been a cornerstone of Norway's EV revolution since the Model S launched there in 2013. Norwegian buyers benefit from VAT exemption on EVs, road tolls exemption, and other significant incentives that make EV ownership highly economical.</p>

  <p>In Norwegian, the referral is a <em>Tesla referansekode</em> or <em>vervekode Tesla</em>. The referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> works for Norwegian orders, with benefits in Norwegian krone (NOK). For Model 3 and Model Y, buyers receive free Supercharging credits; for Model S and Model X, Tesla credits equivalent to up to €500.</p>

  <p>Norway's Supercharger network is exceptionally dense — the country has been a priority market for Tesla since the beginning. Referral Supercharging credits are useful even in Norway's short distances context, covering several hundred kilometres of driving over the 12-month validity period.</p>

  <h2 id="other-countries">Other European Countries</h2>

  <p>The Tesla referral program works across all European markets where Tesla sells directly. Beyond the seven countries covered above, the code <strong>carlo719460</strong> also works in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Austria (Österreich):</strong> Strong EV incentives (Umweltförderung), good Supercharger coverage on the A1 Vienna–Salzburg corridor and Alpine routes</li>
    <li><strong>Belgium:</strong> Strong company car EV incentives; Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent well-served by Superchargers</li>
    <li><strong>Sweden (Sverige):</strong> High EV adoption, dense Supercharger network, VAT applicable but competitive pricing</li>
    <li><strong>Denmark (Danmark):</strong> Copenhagen and major Danish cities have multiple Supercharger sites</li>
    <li><strong>Finland (Suomi):</strong> Growing Tesla market; Helsinki and Tampere have Supercharger facilities</li>
    <li><strong>Poland (Polska):</strong> Fastest-growing Central European EV market; Warsaw, Kraków, and Gdańsk all have Supercharger access</li>
    <li><strong>Portugal:</strong> Lisbon, Porto, and the Algarve covered; MOVES-equivalent EV incentives available</li>
    <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Post-Brexit, the UK program mirrors the EU structure with benefits in GBP</li>
    <li><strong>Ireland:</strong> Dublin and Cork well-served; SEAI grants for EV purchase available</li>
    <li><strong>Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia:</strong> Growing markets with increasing Supercharger coverage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In all of these markets, the process is identical: use <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a> before configuring your vehicle and the benefit is applied automatically.</p>

  <h2 id="tips">Tips &amp; Common Mistakes</h2>

  <p>After helping many people use the Tesla referral program successfully, here are the most common mistakes to avoid — and tips that help:</p>

  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>✅ Do this:</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>Always start your order by clicking the referral link — not by going to tesla.com directly</li>
      <li>Verify the referral benefit appears in your order summary before submitting</li>
      <li>If you're using multiple browser sessions over several days, re-click the referral link each time</li>
      <li>Check your Tesla account after ordering to confirm the pending referral benefit is listed</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="tip-box" style="background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.08); border-color: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3); margin-top: 16px;">
    <strong>❌ Avoid this:</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>Don't navigate to tesla.com first and then try to find the referral option — it won't work that way</li>
      <li>Don't clear your browser cookies between opening the referral link and placing the order</li>
      <li>Don't assume the code can be added after ordering — Tesla explicitly states it cannot be applied retroactively</li>
      <li>Don't use an expired referral link — active owner codes never expire, but always use a confirmed active link</li>
    </ul>
