      <h1>Tesla Is Discontinuing the Model S and Model X: What It Means for Buyers</h1>
      <p class="article-excerpt">Tesla shocked the automotive world when CEO Elon Musk announced the company will discontinue the Model S and Model X in Q2 2026. Here's everything you need to know.</p>

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>Tesla shocked the automotive world on February 28, 2026, when CEO Elon Musk announced during an earnings call that the company will <strong>discontinue the Model S and Model X in Q2 2026</strong>. The move was abrupt — no advance warning, no wind-down period. Just an announcement that two of Tesla's most iconic vehicles would be retired to make room for the company's next big bet: the Optimus robot.</p>

      <h2>Why Is Tesla Killing Its Flagship EVs?</h2>
      <p>Musk's reasoning was straightforward: <strong>factory space is the constraint</strong>. The Fremont plant, where both vehicles are produced, needs to be repurposed for scaling Optimus production. With Tesla's robotics ambitions accelerating, the relatively low-volume (and aging) Model S and Model X were first on the chopping block.</p>
      <p>The Model S and Model X have been around since 2012 and 2015 respectively. While they remained premium offerings — especially the Plaid variants — they were never high-volume sellers. In a world where Tesla is pushing toward mass-market robotics, the math simply didn't work.</p>

      <h2>What This Means If You Were Considering a Model S or X</h2>
      <p>If you've been sitting on the fence about buying a Model S or X, <strong>your window just got very short</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Production ends <strong>Q2 2026</strong> (April–June)</li>
        <li>Existing inventory will be available until sold out — likely within weeks of the announcement</li>
        <li>Certified pre-owned (CPO) prices will likely spike as supply dries up</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is one of those rare moments when "buy now or miss out forever" is actually true.</p>

      <h3>Can You Still Use a Tesla Referral Code?</h3>
      <p>Yes — <strong>until the last car rolls off the line</strong>, Tesla referral codes still work on new Model S and Model X purchases. If you're buying one of the final units, using a referral code gets you benefits and helps fellow Tesla owners earn rewards.</p>
      <p>👉 You can use referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> when purchasing: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/referral/carlo719460" rel="nofollow">tesla.com/referral/carlo719460</a></p>

      <h2>What Replaces the Model S and Model X?</h2>
      <p>Tesla hasn't announced a direct successor for either model, but the company's lineup is evolving:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Y</strong> continues to dominate global sales</li>
        <li><strong>Cybercab</strong> (robotaxi) is in early rollout in Austin, though scaling has been slower than promised</li>
        <li><strong>New Model Y (Juniper refresh)</strong> is the current premium offering for families</li>
        <li><strong>Optimus</strong> — Tesla's humanoid robot — is the new north star</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The luxury EV market segment that the Model S occupied will likely be filled by competitors (Lucid Air, Mercedes EQS) unless Tesla introduces a new premium vehicle.</p>

      <h2>A Note on Tesla's Direction in 2026</h2>
      <p>The discontinuation is part of a broader pattern: Tesla is <strong>betting everything on autonomy and robotics</strong>. The Robotaxi service in Austin has 42 cars running (far below Musk's 500-unit promise), FSD had a high-profile viral fail in February, and now the company's original flagship EVs are being retired.</p>
      <p>For Tesla bulls, this is a company that moves fast and makes bold bets. For skeptics, it's a company that overpromises and under-delivers while quietly sunsetting beloved products.</p>
      <p>One thing is certain: <strong>the Model S and Model X, the cars that proved electric vehicles could be aspirational, are going out on their own terms</strong> — not with a recall or a bankruptcy, but retired to make room for robots.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tesla discontinues Model S + Model X in <strong>Q2 2026</strong></li>
        <li>Factory space needed for <strong>Optimus robot production</strong></li>
        <li>Last chance to buy new — inventory will sell out fast</li>
        <li>Referral code <strong>carlo719460</strong> still valid on remaining stock</li>
        <li>No direct successor announced</li>
      </ul>
